Hi there!  

This repository intents to aggregate codes which implements methods for solving inverse problems. Since this is the subject of my reasearch, I intent to make available everything that I develop throughout my study hopping that it will be useful for people who are also studying it.  

For now, this repository contains:  

- The implementation of examples and methods of chapters 1, 2, and 3 from Andreas Kirsch's book _"An Introduction to Mathematical Theory of Inverse Problems"_;  
- The formulation of Galerkin and Collocation Methods for bidimensional integral equations.  

If you find any mistake, don't hesitate to make a pull request or send me an e-mail.  

Have fun!
